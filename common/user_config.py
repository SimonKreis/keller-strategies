"""Personal-settings loader.

All user-specific values (broker account balances, selected strategies, leverage,
dates, sizing knobs...) live in `user_config.json` at the project root. That file is
GITIGNORED so personal data never reaches the public repository. A committed template
with placeholder values is provided as `user_config.example.json`.

Resolution order for every setting:
    user_config.json  >  the sanitized defaults in main.py's USER DASHBOARD

- Missing file  -> defaults apply silently (fresh clone just works).
- Malformed file -> we FAIL LOUDLY. Live order sizing must never fall back to
  placeholder balances because of a silent JSON typo.
