"""
Run manifests: every saved artefact carries the conditions that produced it.

The 2026-07-28 audit found 92 saved reports in `backtest_results/` and could not establish,
for any of them, which commit produced it, what data it read, what execution convention it
assumed, or what window it actually measured. They had to be quarantined wholesale rather
than corrected, because there was no way to tell which ones were affected by what.

A manifest costs a few hundred bytes and makes that impossible to repeat. It records the
things that change the number: the code, the data, the resolved configuration, and the
measured — not requested — span.

Nothing personal goes in a manifest. `user_config.json` holds real account balances and is
gitignored; the redaction below is a hard filter, not a convention, so a manifest can never
become the route by which a balance reaches the repository.
