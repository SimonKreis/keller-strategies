"""
Named historical regimes, and the publication dates that separate in-sample from out-of-sample.

A leaderboard answers "which variant won?", which §T5.3 shows has no predictive content
(rank correlation between disjoint four-year windows: rho ~ 0). A regime panel answers
"how did each variant BEHAVE when this specific thing happened?", which is a description
rather than a forecast — and descriptions do not decay.

The episode list below is **frozen**. It was written from the historical record, not tuned
to results, and it must not be adjusted because a strategy looks bad in one of the windows.
Adding an episode is a decision to be argued in a commit message.

The critical rendering rule: a cell whose episode predates the strategy's coverage must
print `n/a (inception YYYY-MM)`. Never a number, never a blank, and above all never 0%. Most
leveraged variants will legitimately show `n/a` for dot-com and the GFC, and **that visible
gap is the point** — it makes it impossible to believe a 2x/3x variant survived 2008. No 3x
product predates 2008-11 (UPRO 2009-06, TQQQ 2010-02); the 2x products that do exist mostly
start 2006-2007.
