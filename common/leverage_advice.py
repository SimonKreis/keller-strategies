"""
The consumer `common/margin_sizing.py` did not have.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `margin_sizing` answers "what margin leverage does this model's record
support?" with four caps, a bootstrapped drawdown and a derived Sharpe haircut — and until
2026-07-31 nothing called it. The registry table in LEVERAGE.md section 5.4 was produced by an
ad-hoc script that was not kept, which means the repository's own answer to its central question
was not reproducible from the repository. This module is the missing driver: it turns a
`run_backtest` metrics list into recommendations, and it is what the CLI report and the
dashboard's "Max margin" column both call.

It deliberately holds NO arithmetic. Every formula stays in `margin_sizing`; what lives here is
the assembly — which broker assumptions to use in the absence of a broker, where the trial count
comes from, and how a recommendation is rendered in one table cell.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU NEED FROM A BROKER TO GET AN ANSWER: LESS THAN IT LOOKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The question this module was written to settle is whether a recommendation requires the owner's
actual borrowing terms — a credit line and a negotiated rate that are not known and will not be
for some time. Cap by cap:

  * CAP 4, borrowing capacity — NOT REQUIRED. Left unsupplied, the axis is reported unbounded
    and the fact is carried in `invalidating_assumptions` on every row. It is frequently the cap
    that actually binds in real life, so its absence is stated, never defaulted.
  * The BORROW RATE — required for CAP 2 and for the interest that capitalises during a
    drawdown, but it was already a parameter of this repository (`MARGIN_BORROW_RATE`, 6%) and
    it is an assumption you vary rather than a fact you look up. Its effect is legible: the
    spread `r_b - r_f` is what the Kelly gate divides by, and at a 4-5pp spread the gate is what
    stops most of the registry.
  * The MAINTENANCE MARGIN — required, and this is the only input with no repository default.
    `margin_sizing` refuses to invent one, correctly: 25% is Reg-T for unlevered equity and
    wrong by roughly 3x for a book holding LETFs. What this module supplies instead is a
    REGULATORY-CONVENTION table (below), exposed as one number the user can move.

So the honest summary is: **a first-order answer needs no broker data at all**, and the caps
that would need it say so on their own rows instead of quietly using a plausible number.

THE RULE OF THUMB, IN ONE LINE. Everything else is refinement of CAP 1, which is:

    f = 1 / (m + k * DD * (1 - m))

leverage `f` survivable at maintenance requirement `m` if you insist on surviving `k` times a
drawdown of `DD`. At m=0.45 and a 25% stressed drawdown with k=3, that is 1.2x. Anyone who
expected 1.3x to be comfortably available should read that line before the table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MAINTENANCE TABLE, AND WHY IT IS DERIVED RATHER THAN LISTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`MAINTENANCE_BASE` = 0.30 for an ordinary long ETF position. FINRA Rule 4210(c) sets the FLOOR
at 25% of market value; house requirements on broad-market ETFs are commonly higher, and 30% is
the assumption taken here. It is deliberately above the regulatory minimum and deliberately a
parameter: it is the number to replace first when a real account exists.

For a leveraged product the requirement is the base rate times the FUND'S OWN MULTIPLE — the
convention brokers publish for LETFs, and the reason a 3x book cannot be margined at all
(m = 0.90, and 1.35 once the crisis multiple is applied, i.e. above 1). That multiple is read
off `LETFMapper.MAP_2X` / `MAP_3X`, not from a hand-kept list here, so a product added to either
map inherits its maintenance rate the same day and cannot be forgotten.

Both numbers are ASSUMPTIONS about a broker nobody has chosen yet. They are named in the
policy block that every recommendation echoes, so a reader can see exactly what was assumed
without reading this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip a row. An entry whose KPIs are incomplete comes back as a recommendation of `None` with the
reason attached, and the caller renders "n/c". An entry too short for the drawdown bootstrap
does the same. There is no fallback heuristic anywhere in the chain, because a made-up markup on
a record that never saw 2008 is exactly the failure mode `margin_sizing` was written against.
