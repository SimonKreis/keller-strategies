"""
Price data layer.

The engine used to cache a MONTHLY panel built with ``resample('ME').last()``. That one
call was responsible for three separate audit findings: it emitted a month before the
month had finished, it labelled every row with a synthetic calendar month-end
(``2023-12-31``) that is not a trading date, and it left no way to price an execution at
anything other than the close that produced the signal.

`PriceStore` replaces it. It caches **daily** bars, keeps real trading dates, refuses to
emit a month until that month is over, and carries opens so a fill can be priced at the
session *after* the decision. The monthly panel the strategies consume is derived from it
(`monthly_adj_close`), so strategy code is unaffected by the change.

Yahoo Finance is the external source THE ENGINE READS for every traded price. The one
exception, since 2026-09-23, is a single history DONOR: the LBMA gold fixing, which extends
GLD before its 2004-11 inception, is fetched once from LBMA and cached (`EXTERNAL_DONORS`).
It never prices a traded bar. Since 2026-09-01 `tools/vendor_crosscheck.py` reads a second
vendor for verification only; no engine path imports it, and it lives outside `tests/` so
the suite stays network-free. `adj_close` is Yahoo's back-adjusted close;
`close` is the raw close. Their ratio is the adjustment factor, which is what puts the
*open* on the same adjusted scale as the closes:

    adj_open = open * (adj_close / close)

Without that, an execution priced at the open would mix an unadjusted price into an
adjusted series and manufacture a return at every dividend and split.

ADJUSTMENT_TOLERANCE = 1e-6

#: Bars newer than this (calendar days before the newest overlapping bar) are excluded from

# History extension — 2026-07-29
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every strategy in this repository began after the 2008 crisis had already
# started, so none of them could be measured through the one event they exist to survive. The
# binding constraint was never the strategy: it was the inception date of a fund. BIL began
# 2007-05-30, VEA 2007-07-26, BND 2007-04-10 — all *after* the S&P's 2007-10-09 peak.
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT DONE ABOUT IT. Two mechanisms, both narrow and both declared:
#
#   1. HISTORY_BACKFILL splices an OLDER FUND TRACKING THE SAME INDEX into the leading gap.
#      This is not a substitution: the traded ticker never changes, so the live path keeps
#      buying the cheap Vanguard fund. Only the pre-inception history comes from elsewhere,
#      chain-linked at the level so returns are continuous.
#   2. SYNTHETIC_CASH builds a T-bill total return from the published 13-week bill rate,
#      because no cash ETF predates BIL and the obvious substitute is a trap: SHY returned
#      +6.62% in 2008 against BIL's +1.59%. Splicing SHY in would hand every risk-off month
#      of the crisis a bond rally and manufacture the result being measured.
#
# EVERYTHING HERE IS FLAGGED. `provenance()` reports every spliced and synthetic span, the
# report prints them, and every manifest carries them. A constructed price is not a price.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 2026-09-23 — the era moved to 2000-01, and the donors stopped having to be ETFs
#
# Until today this block said high yield, mortgage REITs and broad commodities could not be
# extended, because no older ETF existed. That was true and it was the wrong question. The
# products that held these asset classes before the ETFs did were MUTUAL FUNDS and published
# INDICES, most of them on Yahoo, and the right question was whether one of them behaves like
# the ETF closely enough to stand in for it. That is a measurement, and it was made.
#
# THE YARDSTICK, fixed before any proxy was judged against it: a donor is admissible when it
# sits no further from the ETF than a SECOND REAL ETF of the same asset class sits from it.
# The market sets that bar, not this file. Measured 2026-09-23 on the real overlap, monthly,
# as 13612U SIGN agreement (the quantity the absolute filters and canaries actually read):
# TIP/SCHP 98.9%, GLD/IAU 100%, HYG/JNK 96.7%, LQD/VCIT 94.7%, DBC/GSG 90.9%. Two real
# commodity ETFs lost -35% and -52% in the same 2008, so for that class the bar is low because
# the class has no single answer — not because this file lowered it.
#
# WHAT FAILED IT, and was dropped rather than admitted: REM (mortgage REITs). An equal-weight
# basket of the four mortgage REITs Yahoo still lists returned -9% through the GFC against
# REM's -52%, because the ones that failed in 2008 are exactly the ones no longer listed.
# That is survivorship bias in its purest form, landing on the one crisis this exists to
# measure. The only strategy holding REM, `DM_G8_Composite`, was deleted the same day at the
# owner's decision (see strategies/gem.py). Also rejected: XLE for commodities (equity, not
# futures: corr 0.70), a gold-MINERS fund for gold (corr 0.59).
#
# KNOWN BIASES OF WHAT WAS ADMITTED, stated so nobody has to rediscover them:
#   * mutual funds strike ONE price a day. Over a constructed span open == close, so a
#     `next_open` fill there is the next day's NAV — the same deviation BIL's synthetic span
#     already carried. A few basis points of timing, in both directions.
#   * a high-yield fund's NAV is marked to thin dealer quotes and so is SMOOTHED: VWEHX fell
#     -20% through the GFC where HYG, trading at a discount, fell -27%. HYG/JNK differ by the
#     same 7 points, but the direction is known — the proxy flatters the HY holder in a crisis.
#   * ^SPGSCI is a PRICE index: no roll yield, no collateral. Its drift against DBC is ~0 and
#     against GSG +3.6%/yr over 2006-2026 (contango); in the backwardated years before 2004
#     the sign of that bias is expected to reverse. The weakest admitted link.
#   * ^NDX is a price index, missing QQQ's small dividend (drift -0.47%/yr).
#
# The measurements are re-runnable, never merely quoted: `tools/proxy_fidelity.py` fetches
# both sides of every pair below and prints them beside the evidence recorded here.

#: One declared substitute. `evidence` is the measurement it was admitted on, dated, in the
#: units the yardstick uses. Re-derive with `tools/proxy_fidelity.py` before quoting it.

        rescales EVERY bar before that date. This refresh overwrites only the trailing
        window, so after any distribution the cache holds two vintages spliced at the window
        edge: recent bars carrying the new adjustment, older bars carrying the old one.

        for "the month finished", and the proxy fails on exactly the day that matters. Run
        live on 2026-08-01, before any August bar exists, and July's month-end is withheld:
        the report then sizes orders from the JUNE decision, a full month stale, and says
        nothing about it.

        The trailing month is admitted only when both are true:

        * `closed_by` is strictly after the store's last observation — never equal, because
          Yahoo publishes a partial bar for the session in progress and a partial bar must
          never be used as a month-end close;
        * no business day remains in that month after the last observation, so no further
          session can arrive to change it.

        Both conditions failing just returns the strict answer, so this can only ever add a
        month the calendar has already closed. Backtests do not pass `closed_by` and are

        `adj_close` is a total-return series and `close` is not, so their ratio

            f(t) = adj_close(t) / close(t)

        is the cumulative dividend-adjustment factor. Every distribution scales all EARLIER
        bars down and leaves raw closes alone, so **f can only rise with time**. A cache
        holding two vintages therefore shows a downward STEP in f exactly at the seam.

        Why this rather than a comparison against a fresh download: the refresh already
        overwrites its whole fetch window, so comparing the merged store against that fetch
        compares fresh data with itself and sees nothing. This test is internal, costs no
        network at all, and works on the paths where no refresh runs -- offline,
        `download=False`, or the throttle -- which is exactly where the 2026-09-01 defect
        survived. Measured across 37 tickers: 108 ms, worst genuine step -2.11e-06, and the
        injected defect -0.0073, a signal-to-noise ratio of about 3450.

        It is not self-referential either: it checks the cache against a property of the
        VENDOR's data model that no code in this repository produced.

        Two exclusions, both found by measurement rather than reasoning:

        * a CONSTRUCTED span is donor data on the donor's own price scale, so its junction
          is a legitimate level change, not a restated dividend. On the real store those
          junctions step -0.126 (VWO), -0.232 (BIL) and -0.018 (BND), each landing exactly
          on that span's `real_from`. `VEA` passes today only because EFA's factor happens
          to sit close, so ALL FOUR declared spans are excluded rather than the three that
          currently fire.
        * the newest `SETTLED_DAYS` bars, where a dividend can be announced and not yet
          applied.
