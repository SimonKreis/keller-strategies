"""
Sustainable margin leverage for a TAA model, from its KPIs.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS, and what it deliberately does not. Given a model's measured record, how
much *borrowed* leverage can it carry indefinitely without being liquidated? Not optimally —
**sustainably**. There is no objective function here, no target return, and no search over the
backtest. `tests/test_margin_sizing.py::test_no_optimisation_surface` fails if one is added.

WHY IT HAD TO BE WRITTEN. `common/ledger.py` prices margin leverage — it draws a debit
balance (`debt`), capitalises interest on it (`debt += interest`), and de-levers with the
signal when `leverage_follows_signal` — but **it never once compares equity to a maintenance
requirement.** There is no such comparison anywhere in the repository. Every levered figure it
has ever produced therefore assumes the margin call does not happen. This module is where that
assumption gets priced, and the honest reading of its output is that some of those figures
describe a portfolio that would have been closed out by a broker.

THE OUTPUT THAT MATTERS IS NOT THE NUMBER. It is `binding_constraint`: which real-world limit
stops this model. A model capped at 1.4x by its own drawdown is a different object from one
capped at 1.4x by a credit line, and only the second can be relaxed by phoning a broker.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FOUR CAPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAP 1 — MARGIN-CALL SURVIVAL. The principal constraint, and the only one whose absence makes
the whole result meaningless (see "non-calculable" below).

At leverage `f`, assets `A = f*E` and debt `D = (f-1)*E`. Liquidation is `E' = m*A'`, so after
a decline `d` in the positions held:

    f(1-d) - (f-1) = m*f*(1-d)      =>      d_max = (1/f - m) / (1 - m)
    inverted:                               f     = 1 / (m + d(1-m))

That form assumes the debt is CONSTANT through the decline, which `ledger.py` itself
contradicts. With `c = r_b * h/12` accrued over a drawdown of duration `h` months:

    d_max = 1 - (f-1)(1+c) / (f(1-m))
    f     = (1+c) / ((1+c) - (1-d)(1-m))

and both reduce to the first pair at `c = 0`. `h` is not a parameter: it is the peak-to-trough
duration of the model's own worst drawdown, which is why `metrics.max_drawdown_months` had to
be added. Peak-to-TROUGH rather than peak-to-recovery, because the call fires at the trough;
interest keeps accruing afterwards but no longer threatens anything.

Arithmetic, at m=0.30, d=0.60, r_b=6%, h=30 months (c=0.15):

    plain formula                1.389
    with interest accrual        1.322
    with m_crise = 1.5m = 0.45   1.282
    with m = 0.75 (a 3x LETF)    1.111     <- see CAP 1 AND LEVERAGED PRODUCTS

The target decline is `d = k * DD_adj`, and `k` is the module's ONLY preference parameter.

CAP 1 AND LEVERAGED PRODUCTS. `m` is not one number when the book holds LETFs — brokers
commonly apply a multiple of the base maintenance rate to 3x products. At m=0.75 the survivable
leverage is 1.11x, so **margin on top of the registry's 3x entries is arithmetically
unavailable**, not merely imprudent. A scalar `m` is therefore REFUSED when
`letf_mapper.holds_leveraged_product` is true: pass a per-ticker mapping or get
"non-calculable". Silently applying a 25% equity rate to a UPRO/TMF book overstates the
answer by roughly 3x, which is failure mode F1.

CAP 2 — KELLY GATE. `f_kelly = SR/sigma` is `mu_e/sigma^2`, the same quantity as `LEVERAGE.md`
section 1. Two corrections to the naive form:

  * The borrow cost applies to `(f-1)`, not to `f`, and under `MARGIN_FOLLOWS_SIGNAL=True`
    only to the offensive fraction. So with `s = r_b - r_f` and `w_off` the mean offensive
    weight, `g(f) = f*mu_e - (f-1)*s*w_off - f^2 sigma^2/2` and

        f_kelly = (mu_e - s * w_off) / sigma^2

    This is an approximation: the effective leverage is a series, not a scalar (see
    `LedgerResult.effective_leverage`). Named as one, and listed in the output's assumptions.

  * SR is haircut for selection bias, and the haircut is DERIVED rather than chosen, because
    this repository knows its own trial count (19 selection trials). Under the null, the
    expected maximum Sharpe across N trials (Bailey & Lopez de Prado) is

        E[max SR] = sd_SR * ( (1-gamma) * Phi^-1(1 - 1/N) + gamma * Phi^-1(1 - 1/(N e)) )
        N = 19, gamma = 0.5772  =>  E[max SR] = 1.878 * sd_SR

    where `sd_SR` is the cross-sectional standard deviation of the trials' own Sharpes — a
    measurement. The haircut is a SUBTRACTION of that term, not a multiplication by a chosen
    coefficient. In parallel, Mertens' higher-moment standard error gives a sampling-error
    lower bound `SR - z*SE`, using the model's measured skew and kurtosis so that negative
    skew widens the interval as it should. **The more severe of the two is used**, and both
    are reported.

    On a model with SR ~= 1.0 and sd_SR ~= 0.25 the derived haircut is ~0.47, i.e. ~47% —
    next to Harvey & Liu's "halve it" rule of thumb. That agreement is the check that says the
    implementation is not broken, not a coincidence to be proud of.

  * Used as a GATE, never a target. `f_kelly < 1` => no leverage is justified and the walk
    stops. Otherwise it enters the `min` and is usually irrelevant, exactly as expected for
    low-vol high-Sharpe models. It is the haircut that makes it capable of binding at all.

CAP 3 — CARRY. **A DIAGNOSTIC, NOT A CAP**, and this is a deliberate departure from the
request. It is mathematically redundant: it fires when `r_b >= mu - sigma^2/2`, while CAP 2
fires (`f_kelly < 1`) when `mu - r_b < sigma^2`, so

    { mu <= r_b + sigma^2/2 }  is a STRICT SUBSET of  { mu < r_b + sigma^2 }

and CAP 3 can never be the binding constraint. It also compares a MARGINAL cost (`r_b`) to an
AVERAGE return (`CAGR`); the correct marginal comparison is CAP 2's first-order condition. It
is retained for two reasons: it is the one line a human reads to sanity-check the inputs, and
it is the fallback when CAP 2 is non-calculable. It never enters the `min`.

CAP 4 — BORROWING CAPACITY. A parameter, and frequently the constraint that actually binds.
One warning it cannot enforce: registered accounts do not permit margin, so the capacity figure
must be the taxable account's equity, not the household's. Filling it in with a total makes
every other number in the output describe a portfolio that cannot be held (F12).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DD_adj — THE TWO CORRECTIONS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) SAMPLE BIAS. An observed maximum drawdown is a sample minimum; the next one is worse. So
    the input is not the observed figure but a high quantile of the drawdown distribution over
    the INTENDED HOLDING HORIZON, obtained by stationary block bootstrap (Politis & Romano) of
    the model's own monthly returns. Horizon, quantile, expected block length and seed are all
    named parameters.

    **The multiplier is an output, not an input.** `dd_factor_sample` reports
    `DD_bootstrapped / DD_observed` per model, and `block_sensitivity` reports the same
    quantile at three block lengths, so the one genuinely arbitrary choice is visible instead
    of buried. That is the whole reason to prefer this over a coefficient: the coefficient
    still exists, but it is measured and printed.

    Below `min_history_months` the answer is non-calculable. There is deliberately no fallback
    heuristic: a made-up markup on a record that never saw 2008 is precisely F2.

(b) INTRA-PERIOD RISK. A monthly-rebalanced model does not react inside the month, so the
    decline in the positions actually held exceeds what a month-end series shows. This is
    MEASURED, not marked up: hold the month's allocation fixed, value it on daily prices, and
    take the ratio of the daily-path drawdown to the month-end one. `intraperiod_max_drawdown`
    does it; the caller passes the result in, because this module takes KPIs and not a
    PriceStore.

    Named residual: daily closes are not intraday, and a margin call is intraday.
    `intraday_pad` exists for it and DEFAULTS TO 1.0 — no padding. A declared gap beats an
    invented coefficient, and it is listed in `invalidating_assumptions` on every call.

    Composed as two visible factors rather than one daily bootstrap. A daily bootstrap would
    be more rigorous and would hide the decomposition, and the decomposition is the point.

    FLOOR: `DD_adj` is never allowed below the observed drawdown. A stressed figure shallower
    than one that already happened is not a stress. When the floor binds it is flagged
    (`dd_floor_binding`), because that means the bootstrap is understating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVERAGE DRIFT — WHERE THE REQUEST IS INVERTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining target leverage PROTECTS against liquidation. When equity falls, `f_eff` rises, and
restoring the target requires SELLING. Worked: m=0.25, f=2, two -20% moves. Unmanaged,
`f_eff` goes 2 -> 2.67 -> 4.57 and the call fires at -36% cumulative. Reset to target after the
first, and it survives. A continuously-maintained constant leverage is never liquidated at all.

So `d_max = (1/f - m)/(1-m)` is already the FULLY-DRIFTED answer, measured from the anchor at
which leverage was last set — the pessimistic case on that axis, not the optimistic one. What
the static calculation genuinely misses is four other things:

    (i)   interest capitalised through the decline        -> the `c` term above
    (ii)  `m` raised by the broker during the crisis      -> `crisis_margin_multiple`
    (iii) the un-defended sub-monthly excursion           -> DD_adj correction (b)
    (iv)  a ONE-SIDED policy that re-levers on gains but never de-levers on losses -> F5

(iii) is the real gap in this engine specifically, and it follows from `ledger.py:340`
(`target = w * mult * equity`): the reset is monthly and unconditional, while the margin call
is continuous. The distance between those two frequencies is the entire residual risk.

`simulate_margin_path` walks a path under a named policy so (iii) and (iv) are testable rather
than argued.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NON-CALCULABLE, AND HOW IT PROPAGATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No input is defaulted silently. A missing or unreliable input makes its cap non-calculable, and:

  * CAP 1 non-calculable  => the WHOLE result is non-calculable. It is the principal
    constraint, and returning `min` over the survivors would answer a cheerful 3x from a
    credit-line parameter while the question of whether the model survives is unanswered.
  * CAP 2 / CAP 4 non-calculable => the result is returned with that axis marked unbounded and
    the fact recorded in `invalidating_assumptions`.

COMPARABILITY. One `MarginPolicy` instance is shared across models and echoed verbatim into
every result, so `test_parameter_block_is_identical_across_models` can assert the blocks match.
Per-model measurements differ; per-model *parameters* do not.

    held and the positions drift with daily prices, which is what a monthly-rebalanced model
    actually does inside the month.

    The uplift over the month-end drawdown is real and unmodelled anywhere else in this
    repository: `ledger.run_ledger` drifts positions from one execution date to the next and
    never looks in between, so nothing it reports can see an excursion that recovered by the
    month end (F11).

    WRITTEN AGAINST THE ARRAYS, not the frames, since 2026-07-31. The obvious form — slice the

    fresh boolean mask over the WHOLE history for each of ~230 months, and then does it again

    and it is what made this measurement too slow to sit in a dashboard column. The index is
    sorted (first statement below), so `searchsorted` gives exactly the same window.
    `tests/test_margin_sizing.py::TestIntraperiodFastPath` pins it against the frame-wise
    reference on random data, because "faster and equal" is a claim that has to be checked
    rather than asserted — it was equal to 1.2e-15 over the whole registry when it landed.

    `np.nansum` where pandas would have used `Series.sum`: pandas skips NaN by default and

    * `deflated_sharpe_probability` is the module's answer to "is this Sharpe real, given
      that N of them were searched" — the multiple-testing correction the whole selection
      apparatus exists to apply — and it reached no screen at all.
    * `block_sensitivity` exists, in this module's own words, "so the one genuinely arbitrary
      choice is visible instead" of hidden. It was hidden.
    * `dd_factor_sample` and `dd_factor_intraperiod` are the two factors the adjusted drawdown
      is deliberately COMPOSED of, rather than being one opaque daily bootstrap. Showing only
      the product turns a decomposition back into the opaque number it was built to replace.
