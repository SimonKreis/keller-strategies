Tests with an anchor OUTSIDE the code.

The 2026-07-28 audit's sharpest structural finding was not any single bug: it was that all
55 tests in this repo asserted `f(x) == f(x)`. Every one of them passed against an engine
with four critical defects, because each line was locally consistent with every other line.

A test only has audit value if what it compares against was not produced by the thing under
test. The anchors here are: arithmetic done by hand in the test file, a published results
table from the source paper, and a mechanism that must produce a known-zero effect in a case
where it cannot possibly apply.
