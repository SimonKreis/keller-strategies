"""
Each strategy against an independent implementation of its paper's rule.

This file exists because of a hole the 2026-07-29 audit found by walking into it. Every
strategy test in this repo asserted SELF-CONSISTENCY — weights sum to one, a dead canary
de-risks, the top four are equal-weighted. Not one of them compared an allocation against
the rule its paper actually states, so two defects sat in plain sight for months:

* DAA filtered its Top-T to strictly-positive momentum, which its paper disclaims three
  times over;
* SMA12 averaged twelve prices where Keller defines it over thirteen.

Both would have died the day a test asked "and what does the paper say?". The mutation
test for this file is the one the audit ran: change `rolling(13)` to `rolling(9)`, drop
DAA's cash slots, swap 13612W for 13612U, invert a BAA canary comparison — each must break
at least one assertion HERE, not merely move a number in the golden master. A golden master
can only say that a number changed; it cannot say which rule is right.

The anchors are hand-built panels whose correct allocation is derivable on paper, and
arithmetic written out in the test. Nothing here calls production code to decide what
production code should have produced.

    in this risky EW portfolio."

    This test pins a filter an external audit asked to REMOVE (2026-07-30, LOGIC-001),
    citing BAA §2's restatement: "like for PAA, we don't use absolute momentum for the Top6
    selection". Keller's 2022 recollection contradicts his own 2016 recipe, and the entry's
    `source` cites the 2016 paper, so the 2016 paper governs. Contrast DAA, where the SAME
    filter was a real defect (its paper disclaims it three times, removed 2026-07-29):
    identical line of code, opposite verdicts, each decided by its own primary source.

    PAA2 cannot show the difference — it holds risk only when n >= 7, where the top six are
    all positive either way — so the anchor is PAA0 (a=0, no clipping), where n < Top with
    CF < 1 is reachable. Mutation standard: replacing `off_mom[off_mom > 0]` with
    `off_mom.dropna()` in `strategies/paa.py` must break this test (six names held, three
    of them negative, at 0.25/6 each).
