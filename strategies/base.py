class BaseStrategy:
    #: How closely this implementation follows its source paper. Declared as a CLASS
    #: attribute so a subclass overrides it by stating one line, and so a leveraged wrap
    #: cannot silently inherit its parent's claim.
    #:
    #:   'faithful' — the paper's algorithm on the paper's universe and tickers.
    #:   'proxy'    — the paper's algorithm and universe, different funds (VAA_G4).
    #:   'custom'   — anything else: a universe or parameterisation nobody published.
    #:
    #: The default is the WEAK claim on purpose. A strategy that forgets to declare is
    #: reported as custom, which is at worst unfair to it; the reverse would put an
    #: unearned fidelity claim in a report, which is the failure mode that matters.
    fidelity = 'custom'

    #: WHERE THE FIDELITY CLAIM COMES FROM — paper, and section or figure. Required for
    #: every registered entry; `tests/test_anchors.py` asserts it is present and non-empty.
    #:
    #: This exists because `fidelity` on its own is an unfalsifiable string. The label was
    #: wrong three separate times — DM_G8_Composite, HAA_G1_Simple and VAA_G4 — always in
    #: the under-claiming direction, and the only test on it checked that the value was one
    #: of three legal words. A citation converts an opinion into something a reader can
    #: check against the cited SSRN paper, which is the difference between a claim
    #: and an assertion.
    #:
    #: A 'custom' entry cites what it DEPARTS from, so the departure is reviewable too.
    source = ''

    #: What this entry is FOR. The organising question is *"would you hold it?"* — because that
    #: is what decides whether it counts as a TRIAL in the best-of-N and participation-ratio
    #: machinery. A thing nobody would hold is not a trial anybody ran.
    #:   'strategy'    — a candidate you might actually allocate to. THE ONLY role counted as
    #:                   a trial (`main.py` filters the selection statistics on it).
    #:   'control'     — a degenerate case (single-asset) that exists to show how much of a
    #:                   family's result comes from its universe rather than its timing rule.
    #:                   Reported, excluded from the selection statistics.
    #:   'benchmark'   — a passive reference: no signal, no de-risking rule. Three of them ARE
    #:                   levered as of 2026-07-29 (SPY_2X, SPY_3X, RiskParity_3X) — a levered
    #:                   wrap compared only against 1x references cannot be decomposed into
    #:                   "what the timing rule added" and "what the leverage added".
    #:   'exploratory' — added 2026-07-29 for the 3x variants. A real strategy with a real
    #:                   signal, measured and reported in full, that NOBODY IN THIS PROJECT
    #:                   INTENDS TO HOLD. Same treatment as 'control' and for the same reason,
    #:                   but a different reason for not holding it: not degeneracy, but that
    #:                   **no 3x product predates 2008-11**, so its worst case is structurally
    #:                   unobservable and its drawdown column is a bull-market number.
    #:
    #:                   This role is what makes the 3x expansion safe. Twelve 3x entries with
    #:                   20%+ CAGRs would otherwise sit at the top of a Sortino-ranked table and
    #:                   be absorbed as twelve more trials, inflating the multiple-comparison
    #:                   correction against the entries that ARE candidates. With it, the trial
    #:                   count moves 18 -> 19 while the registry grows by twelve.
    #:
    #: DERIVED, not assigned, for anything with `leverage >= 3`: see the property below. A
    #: subclass may still override with a plain class attribute (`role = 'benchmark'`), which
    #: shadows the property as usual.
