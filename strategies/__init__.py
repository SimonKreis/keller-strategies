# This list mirrors main.ALL_STRATEGIES, which carries the admission rule: a paper-faithful
# variant, the same on proxy funds, a leverage-forced custom universe, a control, or a
# benchmark. Sixteen entries were deleted on 2026-07-28; the reason for each is recorded in
# the module where its class used to live.

# Leveraged variants — CUSTOM universes, admitted only by the five rules in
# common/letf_mapper.py. Two of those rules cut this list on 2026-07-29:
#
#   RULE 4 (the wrap may change what is HELD, never what decides to DE-RISK) removed the
#   VAA and PAA wraps outright. Both families protect by counting breadth over their own
#   offensive universe, so shrinking that universe to SPY/QQQ/IWM(/GLD) does not narrow
#   the portfolio, it replaces the risk sensor. See strategies/vaa.py and strategies/paa.py.
#
#   RULE 5 (a cash ladder must survive the restriction) removed DAA_G3: T=1 against B=2
#   rounded a lone dead canary down to zero de-risking.
#
# HAA joined for the same reason the others left — its TIP canary is exogenous and the
# restriction cannot reach it. G2 was already gone: SPY+QQQ correlate 0.911, so its
# "selection" selected nothing. G4 is 2x-only because gold has no 3x product.
