# LIVE ORDER-SIZING KNOBS (used only when EXECUTION_MODE = True). These shape how target
# weights become whole-share orders across your accounts; NONE of them affect the backtest.
# - SAFETY_MARGIN_PCT: ~2.0% keeps a cash reserve per account so orders aren't rejected on price moves mid-execution.
# - FLEXIBILITY_BAND_PCT: ~5.0%. One-sided DOWNWARD tolerance — accept UNDER-filling a position by up to X% rather than splitting the last sliver into a lower-priority account.
# - FLUSH_ROUND_UP_BAND_PCT: 0 = off. One-sided UPWARD tolerance — round the last lot UP to deploy idle cash, overshooting a position's target by at most X%, and only when the extra lot fits the account's usable balance (never touches the safety reserve). Handy for small accounts without fractional shares.
# - PRICE_CAP_MARGIN_PCT: 0 = off. Limit-price ceiling for after-hours GTC orders (e.g. IBKR
#   Midprice with a price cap): cap = live quote × (1 + X%). Shares are SIZED AT THE CAP
#   (worst-case cost), so the broker's funds check passes by construction — no rejections —
#   while the cap still sits above the market, so next-morning execution is near-certain.
#   Fills below the cap (the normal midprice case) leave a small cash residue = your price
#   improvement. ~1.5% covers a typical overnight gap on liquid ETFs.

# 4. LIST OF STRATEGIES TO EXECUTE (project default / catalog)
# Add or remove a hashtag (#) in front of a strategy to enable or disable it.
# NOTE: user_config.json overrides this catalog, and the CLI flag `--strategy` overrides
# everything. Two config forms are accepted, in this order:
#   "STRATEGIES"          — legacy allow-list of registry keys (`--list`), still honoured
#   "EXCLUDED_STRATEGIES" — the dashboard's deny-list: run everything except these
# The dashboard writes the deny-list, so unticking a box there changes what `python main.py`
# runs too. That is deliberate: the two must never report different line-ups.
#
# NOTE — OUR TAKE (the project creators', not an official or impartial ranking):
# We favor the HAA family for STRUCTURAL reasons: a single external canary (TIP) rather than a
# breadth count, a defensive sleeve that picks between BIL and IEF instead of defaulting to one,
# and the most recent of Keller's papers. G12 is preferred over G8 for asset-class breadth —
# twelve sleeves spanning US/ex-US equity, REITs, commodities, gold and three bond tenors — not
# for its backtested rank.
#
# That distinction matters, because the performance claim this note used to make was false twice
# over. On the owner's own window HAA_G1_Simple scored a HIGHER Sharpe and Sortino than HAA_G12;
# and in Keller's own Dec-1970..Dec-2022 results HAA-8 beats HAA-12 on BOTH max drawdown (-9.7%
# vs -10.7%) and Sharpe (1.21 vs 1.19) at identical 15.9% CAGR. There is no support for a G12
# performance preference in the source paper either.
#
# More generally: do not choose a variant from the ranked table. The report prints the rank
# correlation of that table between disjoint sub-periods, and it is approximately zero. The table
# is a description of what each regime rewarded, not a forecast.
# This is a personal preference/bias, NOT a scientific or impartial recommendation, and NOT
# financial advice. Do your own research; 0 liability.

# FOURTH registry change, 2026-09-23 (36 -> 35). Deleted: DM_G8_Composite. Not for a defect in
# its rules — those were Antonacci's, verified against SSRN 2042750 — but for the one thing it
# alone could not have: history. The era moved to 2000-01 the same day on mutual-fund and index
# donors (common/data_engine.HISTORY_BACKFILL), and every published entry reached it except
# this one, whose mortgage-REIT leg REM (2007-05) has no admissible donor: the only candidates
# are the mortgage REITs still listed, which lost 9% through the GFC where REM lost 52%,
# because the ones that failed are the ones that vanished. Kept, it would have held the shared
# window at 2008-07 for every other row. The owner judged it had never distinguished itself.
#
# THIRD registry change, 2026-07-29 (25 -> 22 -> 23), and it went both ways. Deleted: the four
# VAA/PAA leveraged wraps (RULE 4 — their protection is a breadth count over their OWN offensive
# universe, so restricting it for LETF execution rewrites the protection rule) and
# DAA_G3_Leveraged_2X (RULE 5). Added: HAA_G3/G4_Leveraged_2X. Then DAA_G3_Leveraged_2X was
# RESTORED the same day: RULE 5 had been written as a filter that deletes variants with T < B,
# and reads better as one that CHOOSES T = max(n//2, B). The variant was never defective — the
# parameter was. It ranks seventh of nine on Sortino, so the restoration is not a performance
# argument; see strategies/daa_leveraged.py for the b=0/b=1/b=2 decomposition.
#
# SECOND registry reduction, 2026-07-28 (39 -> 23), on the admission rule stated above the
# dict. Deleted: HAA_G4, HAA_G16 (custom sizes; G16 rho 0.935 vs G12 and started a year
# later); DAA_U6, DAA_U15, VAA_U6, VAA_U15 (custom US-only universes that also ranked BIL as
# an offensive momentum asset); DAA1_G12 (non-paper defensive sleeve containing UST, a 2x
# treasury ETF — see common/letf_mapper.assert_unlevered_defensive — and the single most
# expensive entry for coverage, dragging the comparison window from 2008-07 to 2011-04);
# BAA_G4_T2 (TO twiddle, rho 0.894); GTAA_G13_Moderate and GTAA_G13_Aggressive (no published
# Faber source for either, same universe, and the Aggressive one hybridised Keller's 13612U
# with Faber's SMA); and the four *_G2_Leveraged_2X (SPY+QQQ, rho 0.92 — a two-asset momentum
# choice between near-identical assets is not a choice).
#
# FIRST registry reduction, 2026-07-28 (64 -> 39), on two measured criteria kept deliberately
# separate.
#
# 1. REDUNDANCY. Over 156 common months (2012-01..2024-12), every leveraged 3X variant measured
#    rho ~= 0.996-0.999 against its own 2X sibling: same signal, same calendar, exposure merely
#    rescaled. The 3X entries were dropped (the factories still accept leverage=3 for ad-hoc
#    study; they are simply not registered, so they no longer inflate the ranking). Note the
#    honest caveat: rho ~= 0.999 means near-identical SHAPE, not magnitude — a 3x drawdown is far
#    worse than a 2x one. What was removed is a number that is both derivable and unrepresentative,
#    since no 3x product predates 2008-11 and therefore no 3x drawdown here has seen a bear market.
#    Also dropped on the same criterion: PAA_G12_V0/V1 (rho 0.974-0.982 vs V2), BAA_G12_T3
#    (rho 0.951 vs BAA_G12), and three of the four leveraged GEM sleeves (rho 0.95-0.999).
#
# 2. FIDELITY / NON-CONTRIBUTION. FAA, MAA, EAA, LAA, RAA and CAA were removed entirely. Across 8
#    named drawdown episodes, not one of them ever outperformed every retained strategy; the only
#    departures from the retained envelope were downside (MAA -13.3% in 2015-16, RAA -20.6% in the
#    2022 bear — worse than SPY). LAA measured rho 0.93 against the Golden_Butterfly benchmark that
#    is retained. MAA's low correlation with the rest was the decorrelation of a bug, not
#    information: MAA_G7 vs MAA_G7_TV was rho = 1.000, i.e. its shrinkage parameters did nothing.
#    None of the six implemented its source paper faithfully. See KNOWN_GAPS.md §6.

    1. **`fidelity == 'custom'`** — an entry nobody published. Four custom leveraged G4 wraps
       sharing UGL's 2008-12 inception were dragging the headline table from 2008-06 to 2010-02
       for all 25 entries, so the flagship drawdown column excluded the crisis this project
       exists to measure (REPORT-002).
    2. **holds a leveraged product** — structural, read off the tickers. Every LETF launched
       late (UWM 2007-01 is the earliest 2x, TNA 2008-11 the earliest 3x), so such an entry
       always shortens the table and always by years.

    The second is not redundant. The first caught the 2x wraps only because they happen to be
    labelled `custom`; a levered BENCHMARK has as good a claim to `faithful` as `SPY_Benchmark`
    does ("no rule to be faithful or unfaithful to"), and labelling it so would hand 100% UPRO
    the power to cost every other row its 2008 — the same defect, re-entering through the label
    instead of the role.

    Nothing is hidden and nothing is dropped: an excluded entry is still measured over its own
    history, in a separated block. What changes is only whose inception may shorten other rows.
