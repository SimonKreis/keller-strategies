## Deleted, 2026-09-23

`DM_G8_Composite` left the registry the day the era moved to 2000-01.
Every other published entry reached 2000-01 on mutual-fund and index donors
(`common/data_engine.HISTORY_BACKFILL`); this one could not, because its mortgage-REIT leg has
no admissible donor. The only candidates are the mortgage REITs still listed, and an
equal-weight basket of them returned **-9%** through the GFC against REM's **-52%** — the
ones that failed are the ones no longer listed. Kept, the entry would alone have held the
shared window at 2008-07 for every other row.

**What was given up, stated so it is not rediscovered as an oversight:** the section below,
*Why it is kept*, argued that this was the most mechanistically distinct entry in the registry
(ρ_max 0.705) in a suite of ~3 effective independent bets. That argument was known and was
outweighed: the entry had never distinguished itself on results, and the
cost of keeping it was eight years of shared window for everyone else. The participation ratio
moved from 2.65 to 2.58 effective bets the same day, with the era change; the two causes have
not been separated. The rest of this spec is kept as the record of what the entry was.

## Correction, 2026-07-29

This spec previously described the implementation as `GEM_G8_FourModule_Custom`, "❌ NOT a
reproduction", and asserted that it used "three asset pairs Antonacci never proposed". **That
was wrong.** The credit, REIT and gold/Treasury pairs are Antonacci's own, from §§3-6 and
Table 10 of the paper above — the paper this repository already had on disk and cited as the
strategy's "nominal ancestor".

The error was in the *ancestor*, not the algorithm. **Global Equities Momentum (GEM)** is a
different Antonacci strategy: one module, US versus ex-US equity, defending into aggregate
bonds. The file implemented the 2012 paper's **modular** construction and was then measured
against GEM, which made a faithful implementation look invented. Fixing it required renaming,
not rewriting: not one line of the allocation logic changed.

This is the one direction of labelling error this repository had not yet caught — *under*
claiming. It is worth as much attention as over-claiming, because a wrong `custom` label is
still a wrong label, and it was used to argue the strategy might be deletable.

## Rules, as published

**Dual momentum** (p. 4) is two filters applied in order, per module:

> "First, we choose between our module's non-Treasury bill assets using relative strength
> momentum. If our selected asset does not also show positive momentum with respect to
> Treasury bills (meaning it does not have positive absolute momentum), we select Treasury
> bills as an alternative proxy investment."

**Formation period** (p. 6): twelve months, chosen explicitly —

> "Since twelve months is more common and has lower transaction costs, we will use that
> timeframe."

**The four modules** (§§3-6, summarised in Table 10) and **equal weighting** (§9): the
headline portfolio is "an equally weighted composite of all four dual momentum modules", with
a footnote citing DeMiguel, Garlappi & Uppal (2009) — equal weights beat optimisers once
estimation error is counted.

| module | paper's asset 1 | paper's asset 2 | defensive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equities | MSCI U.S. | MSCI EAFE+ | T-bills |
| Credit Risk | Hi Yield | Credit | T-bills |
| REITs | Equity REIT | Mortgage REIT | T-bills |
| Stress | Gold | LT Treasuries | T-bills |

The stress module's logic (§6): "Both gold and long-term Treasury bonds may react positively
to weakness in the economy... Gold represents a flight from uncertainty, while Treasuries
represent a flight toward quality."

## Registered variants

| key | universe | type |
|---|---|---|
| `DM_G8_Composite` | SPY/VEA, HYG/LQD, VNQ/REM, GLD/TLT, each defending into BIL, 25% per module | proxy, **deleted 2026-09-23** |
| `GEM_G2_Classic` | SPY vs VEU, absolute gauge on SPY vs BIL **first**, defending into BND | proxy |
| `DM_G3_Leveraged_2X` | one module on SPY/QQQ/IWM, defending into BIL, offensive sleeve mapped to 2x LETFs | custom |

## GEM — the single-module flagship (added 2026-07-30)

**Source:** *Dual Momentum Investing* (McGraw-Hill, 2014) and the published GEM decision
tree (optimalmomentum.com). Stated assets: S&P 500, MSCI ACWI ex-US, Barclays US Aggregate.
The book has no SSRN paper, which is why the fidelity pin holds
the book title rather than a paper number.

**The decision tree, in the BOOK's order — which is NOT this paper's order:**

1. **Absolute momentum first, gauged on the S&P 500 alone:** 12-month SPY return vs the
   12-month T-bill return. If SPY fails → **aggregate bonds**, and the relative leg is
   never consulted.
2. **Relative momentum second:** hold the better 12-month performer of SPY and ACWI ex-US.

The 2012 paper's equities module (above) inverts this — relative first, absolute on the
*winner*, defending into T-bills. The orderings disagree observably (e.g. SPY fails the
gate while winning the relative leg: GEM holds BND where the 2012 module holds BIL), and
`tests/test_paper_rules.py::TestGEMFlowchart` pins the book's ordering against the mutation
that would quietly "unify" the two. Tickers: `SPY / VEU / BND`, gauge `BIL`. VEU (Vanguard
FTSE All-World ex-US, 2007-03) stands in for ACWI ex-US — same fund-family preference as
the VAA n.11 correction, and it predates iShares ACWX (2008-03). BND is spliced from AGG,
which is the book's own aggregate index.

**GEM has no leveraged variant, and that is a derivation, not an omission.** RULE 1: VEU
has no LETF above the $100M floor (EFO ~$27M, and it tracks EAFE, not ACWI ex-US). A wrap
restricted to US tickers with products (`SPY/QQQ/IWM`) is no longer GEM — it is
single-module dual momentum on a US universe, which is exactly `DM_G3_Leveraged_2X/3X`,
already registered; the residual difference (defending into BND rather than BIL) is a
parameter twiddle of the kind `BAA_G4_T2` was deleted for. GEM joins VAA and PAA in
having no wrap — theirs under RULE 4, this one under RULE 1 plus the duplication bar.

## Deviations

- **ETF proxies for index series.** The paper runs on MSCI/index data from January 1974; this
  runs on `SPY, VEA, HYG, LQD, VNQ, REM, GLD, TLT, BIL`. The binding inception is VEA
  (2007-07), so the first measurable month is **2008-09** — the sample misses 34 of the
  paper's 38 years, including every regime that motivated the stress module.
- **A module with any missing input allocates its 25% to BIL**, the direction that de-risks.
  The paper has no such case; its indices exist throughout.
- **`DM_G3_Leveraged_2X` is custom and the reason is worth naming.** Antonacci's modules pair
  assets that are economically *opposed*. `{SPY, QQQ, IWM}` is three slices of one market,
  chosen because they are what executes at a uniform 2x multiple. That is a leverage
  constraint dictating an investment universe, which is the opposite of the paper's logic.

## Why it was kept (until 2026-09-23)

Beyond fidelity: it is **the most mechanistically distinct entry in the registry** — its
highest correlation against any other variant is ρ = 0.705, where the next most distinct sits
at 0.741. Everything else here is a momentum ranking over overlapping universes; this is the
one row in the regime panel that can move differently. A suite whose participation ratio is
~3 effective independent bets cannot afford to lose its most decorrelated member.

## Cannot verify

- The paper's 1974-2011 sample. Nothing here reaches before 2000: since 2026-09-23
  `GEM_G2_Classic` is measured from 2000-01 on donor history ([`../KNOWN_GAPS.md`](../KNOWN_GAPS.md) §2),
  and the deleted composite never reached before 2008.
- Whether the ETF proxies would have reproduced the paper's index-level module selections
  over the overlapping years — in particular `REM` for the mortgage-REIT leg, whose index
  history and ETF history diverge sharply through 2008-2009.
