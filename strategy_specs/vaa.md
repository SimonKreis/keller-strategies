## Rules, as published

**Momentum — 13612W** (p. 4). The 12-4-2-1 weighted score:

```
score = 12·r1 + 4·r3 + 2·r6 + 1·r12
```

**Breadth momentum — the paper's central contribution** (pp. 1-5). VAA has no external canary.
The offensive universe *is* the breadth indicator: `b` counts how many of the N offensive
assets score non-positive, and the cash fraction follows from `b` alone.

**Cash fraction** (p. 5):

```
CF = (1/T) · rounddown( b·T / B ),   capped at 1
```

with `T` the number of offensive slots and `B` the breadth parameter. The paper's own worked
example on p. 5 — *T = 3, b = 2, B = 4 gives CF = 1/3* — is what pins the `rounddown`. Both
2026-07-28 audits initially suspected that quantisation was an implementation artefact; it is
not, it is the paper's rule, and `strategies/vaa.py` implements it exactly via
`n_cash_slots = floor(b·T/B)`, `CF = n_cash_slots / T`.

**Risk-off allocation** (p. 5). The cash fraction goes entirely to the **single best**
defensive asset by 13612W score, not spread across the defensive sleeve. When
`n_cash_slots ≥ T`, the whole book sits there.

**Rebalancing** (p. 5, note 7). Monthly, including rebalancing open positions back to their
prescribed `w = 1/T` weights — so turnover is not zero even in a month with no change of
holdings. The ledger models this correctly: positions drift between rebalances and are traded
back, which is why VAA shows the highest realised turnover in the registry (~16×/yr).

**Top-T is SIGN-AGNOSTIC** (§5). The paper declines absolute momentum on the selection and
says why: *"in the case where b<N, the (rounded) cash fraction CF is always higher with VAA
than in the traditional Dual case. So no bad assets will show up in the remaining Top
assets."* The breadth count has already been spent by the cash ladder; filtering the
survivors to positive momentum would count it twice. **`strategies/vaa.py` applied exactly
that `> 0` filter until 2026-07-30** — the same defect corrected in DAA on 2026-07-29,
unswept in its two siblings. Measured before the change: **zero months** of the real panel
where the filter altered the Top-T (the §5 argument holds structurally at `T=2, B=4`), so
the correction is a provable no-op on the registry, guarded by the golden master.

**`T = 1` goes all-in-cash the moment `b ≥ 1`** (§4): *"When B=1 or T=1 the whole portfolio
is fully invested in cash (when b>=1) or fully invested in the top T risky asset(s) (when
b=0)."* The floor formula only reproduces this at `B = 1` (which is `VAA_G4`'s registered
configuration); at `T=1, B>1` it would stay fully risky, and since 2026-07-30 the code
implements the paper's sentence. Note this is **VAA's own rule and differs from DAA n.8**,
which grades the same case to `CF = b/B` — each paper governs its own family.

**NaN policy.** A missing score counts toward `b`, i.e. toward risk-off. Never the reverse.
A missing score is also never *rankable*: the Top-T draws from `dropna()`, not from a sign
filter.

## Registered variants

| key | offensive universe | T | B | defensive |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `VAA_G12` | SPY, IWM, QQQ, VGK, EWJ, **VWO, VNQ**, GSG, GLD, TLT, LQD, HYG | 2 | 4 | SHY, IEF, LQD |
| `VAA_G4` | SPY, VEA, VWO, BND | 1 | 1 | SHY, IEF, LQD |

**VAA has no leveraged variant, and that is a finding rather than an omission.** The two
`VAA_G3/G4_Leveraged_2X` wraps were DELETED on 2026-07-29 under RULE 4 in
[`../common/letf_mapper.py`](../common/letf_mapper.py) — *a wrap may change what is HELD,
never what decides to DE-RISK.*

VAA declares no canary on purpose (`sleeves()` returns `'canary': []`, and the docstring
explains why): its crash signal **is** the breadth count `b` over its own offensive universe,
divided by `B`. A leveraged wrap must restrict that universe to what executes at one uniform
multiple, and `VAALeveraged` accordingly set `self.B = n`. So the restriction did not narrow
the portfolio and leave the rule alone — it rebuilt the rule out of three US equity ETFs
correlating 0.79-0.91 with each other. Counting how many of twelve asset classes have rolled
over is a market-breadth signal; counting how many of SPY/QQQ/IWM have is asking one question
three times.

Measured over 2010-02…2026-06: `VAA_G3_Leveraged_2X` correlated **0.376** with `VAA_G12` —
the lowest wrap-to-parent figure in the registry, against 0.823 for `BAA_G4`. That is a
fidelity measurement, not a performance ranking, which is why it was allowed to decide. There
is no fix: enlarging the universe until the breadth count means something again requires
assets with no admissible LETF, and any smaller universe reproduces the defect.

## Deviations

- **`VAA_G4`'s tickers ARE the paper's, and this spec said otherwise until 2026-07-29.**
  The body text names `SPY, EFA, EEM, AGG`, but footnote 11 says what was actually run:
  *"We actually used (proxies for) Vanguard ETFs **VEA, VWO, VNQ, and BND** instead of the
  mentioned (and more common) iShares ETFs EFA, EEM, IYR, and AGG, respectively, in nearly
  all our backtest since these ETFs has lower fees and similar AUM's"*. The DAA paper
  restates VAA-G4 directly as `R4 = SPY, VEA, VWO, BND`. So `VAA_G4` is **faithful**; it
  carried `proxy` on a premise its own source contradicts.
- **`VAA_G12` now holds `VWO` and `VNQ`, and held `EEM` and `IYR` until 2026-07-29.**
  The same footnote 11 governs both variants, and it was applied to `VAA_G4` while `VAA_G12`
  was left on the iShares names — an inconsistency, not a decision. The earlier defence
  ("Keller treats the two fund families as interchangeable, so either set is his") does not
  survive re-reading: the footnote does not say the funds are equivalent, it says **which
  ones he ran**, and gives his reason. His reason is verifiable and holds today:

  | exposure | Keller's fund | body-text fund | expense ratio | AUM |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | emerging markets | **VWO** | EEM | **0.06%** vs 0.72% | both large |
  | US real estate | **VNQ** | IYR | **0.13%** vs 0.42% | $54.4B vs $3.1B |

  (Expense ratios and AUM as of 2026-07. Note the one thing the footnote gets wrong for
  today's market: it says "similar AUM's", and VNQ is now roughly 18x the size of IYR.)

  **The switch made the strategy look WORSE, which is the useful part.** Over 2015-01…2024-12
  (the golden-master window) CAGR fell 3.53% → 3.03%, MaxDD deepened −27.03% → −28.03%, and
  Sortino fell 0.39 → 0.31. A ticker correction that cost performance is a correction, not a
  fit. Coverage is unaffected: `VWO`'s pre-inception history is chain-linked from `EEM`
  (`HISTORY_BACKFILL`, both tracked MSCI EM until 2013), `VNQ` (2004-09) starts well before
  the binding `HYG` (2007-04), and the measured window stayed 2008-06…2026-06. (Since
  2026-09-23 the era opens 2000-01 and every ticker here is carried back on a donor.)
- **`VAA_U6` and `VAA_U15` were DELETED on 2026-07-28.** The algorithm was the paper's; the
  asset lists were not, and both ranked `BIL` inside the offensive momentum universe. They
  were, measured, the two most DISTINCT entries in the whole registry (ρ_max 0.655 and 0.676)
  and that was not enough to keep them: distinctness manufactured by an unpublished universe
  is a degree of freedom, not evidence.
- **No canary is declared to `sleeves()`, deliberately.** VAA's de-risking rule is a breadth
  *count*, whereas `BaseStrategy.defensive_mask` implements "any canary down ⇒ risk-off".
  Passing the offensive universe in as a canary would mark dual-role LQD defensive in almost
  every month, since some asset in a 12-asset universe is nearly always negative. With no
  canary, dual-role LQD counts as offensive — the conservative direction, per `BaseStrategy`.

## Cannot verify

- The paper's pre-2000 sample.
- Whether the Vanguard and iShares funds would have produced the same monthly selections as each other, in either variant. Footnote 11 says which funds Keller ran, not that the two families are interchangeable; this repo has not measured it.
